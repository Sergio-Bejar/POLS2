# What is **Politics**?

# Definition of Politics 

We live in world with limited resources and we all have different needs and preferences as to how to distribute them. 

<br> 

So we need to find a way to distribute those limited resources efficiently!  he key is who gets the **power** to make such decisions.

<br>

**Politics** is the set of activities related with making the decision of who gets what, how and when.

**Definition:**The systematic study of how people around the world make and contest authoritative public choices

**It focuses on a variety of topics, some examples are:**
- Patterns concerning political events
(*i.e. Campaigns or elections*)

- Patterns pertaining to historical eras:
(*i.e. The Enlightenment or the Cold War*)

- Patterns concerning recently relevant events:
(*i.e. Democratization in the Muslim countries*)

**In a nutshell, we will study how *politics* works around the world!**

# How Do We Research in Comparative Politics?

We use the **Comparative Method**.  This means that we **compare** cases in order to answer relevant research questions (usually about real world events.

**Example of a Research Question in CP:** Why do some countries have democratic regimes while others do not? 

<br>

We formulate **hypotheses** that seek to answer our research questions. 

**Example of a Hypothesis:** The wealthier the country, the higher the probability of being a democracy.  

<br> 

A hypothesis proposes a link that connects a cause with an effect.  They are very useful because they can be tested accross multiple cases.

# Methods Used to Test a Hypothesis in CP

**Qualitative**: Uses few cases, not good for generalization but helpful for theory development.

<br> 

Some examples are
1. Comparative Method
2. Case Studies (i.e. in-depth analysis of one case)
3. Structured/unstructured interviews

<br>

**Quantitative**:  Uses a large number of cases, very good for generalization.  But it sometimes is not good explaining specific cases. 

<br> 

1. Regression analysis 
2. Experiments

# The Comparative Method

Method of Agreement vs. Method of Difference

# Method of Agreement

**Definition:**Compares and contrasts cases with different attributes but shared outcomes

**Outcome Variable (i.e. the one we are trying to explain:**) Civil War.

We are trying to find the cause that explains why countries went to war.  Countries 1-4 DID go to war, country 5 DID NOT.  
]

The only variable that is similar among countries 1-4 is **Ethinically Divided**, country 5 is **Ethnically Homogeneous**.  So the most likey cause for war is having an **Ethnically Divided** society.

# Method of Difference

**Definition:** Compares and contrasts cases with the same attributes but different outcomes

**Outcome Variable (i.e. the one we are trying to explain:**) Civil War.

We are trying to find the cause that explains why countries went to war.  Countries 1-4 DID NOT go to war, country 5 DID.  
]

The only variable that is different between country 5 and countries 1-4 is the terrian (i.e. **flat**). So we can infer that there is a relationship between the type of terrain and the likelihood of going to war.

# Quantitative Research

# What is Quantitative Research? 

The use of statististics to test hypothesis using a large number of cases.  

<br>

This is not a statistics class, so we will leave it at that for now.  But the use of statistical models to test hypothesis is very common in Comparative Politics.
